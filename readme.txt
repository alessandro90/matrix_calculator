				      Matrix Calculator
				      *****************

This is a Python 3 GUI application which allows the computation of some matrix operations.
Choose the desired operation from the menu and write your matrix/matrices.
Use white spaces or tabs to separate the matrix elements in a row.
Press 'ENTER' to begin another row.
The number of rows/columns for the matrix is not fixed, you can write matrices of arbitrary 
dimensions.
Complex numbers are supported. To write a complex number append a 'j' after the imaginary part
of the number, e.g., 5-6j (no white spaces/tabs between real and imaginary parts).
The number of significant digits displayed in the result can be set from 1 to 20.
To start the calculator launch calculator.py.

Currently supported operations:
-Sum (two matrices needed);
-Multiplication (two matrices needed);
-Determinant;
-Eigenvalues;
-Eigenvectors;
-Singular values;
-Inverse matrix;
-Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse.

Dependencies:
-Numpy;
-Tkinter.
